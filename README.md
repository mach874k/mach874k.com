## Hugo's stuff
[Hugo's official website](https://gohugo.io/) has a lot of interesting content that can be useful for us, don't forget to take a look at it in case of doubts. Everything that is in this README was taken from there.

### Instalation
For Debian and Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install hugo
```
For Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -Syu hugo
```
For others, look at [Hugo's installing page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) 

### Most used commands (for us)
Run ```hugo serve``` to start the website in LiveReload mode. It'll build on port ```:1313```. <br>
The flags ```-D```, ```-E```, ```-F```, can be used to build it with draft content, expired content, and future content, respectively

(that's all for now)

### Tutorials and things like that
The [External Learning Resources](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/external-learning-resources/) page, at gohugo, has a list of tutorials and books that can be useful.

## Airspace's stuff
[Airspace](https://docs.gethugothemes.com/airspace/) is the theme we're using, and most of the information we'll need to update the site will be at its site. (out of date :disappointed:)

## Icons
More icons can be found at [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/v2/) and used at the config.toml as the example below:
```
icon = "ion-social-pinterest-outline" #ionicon pack v2 : https://ionicons.com/v2/
