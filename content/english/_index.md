  So far we are working on our fisrt game called Reality RPG. In summary it is a Cyber Fantasy Augmented reality mobile Adventure in the Real World. The idea is for it to be an immersive GPS location based game. Think Pokemon Go, but with Epic heroes, quests, character building, items, guilds, parties and grid based strategy combat.
