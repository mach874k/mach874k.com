## Reality RPG

Reality RPG is our big pet project. This is a game that we started developing because it is a game that we already want to play. After having experienced other georeferenced games like Pokemon Go and Orna, we felt like these games could have been way better if they would better build apon what augmented reality brings to the table. That's exactly what we want to do.

Our main focus is exploration, engagement, and immersiveness. We want the player to be able to hunt for rare Heroes, rare monsters and equipments. Delivering possibilities for grinding, creating custom player content and just having a RPG feel interconnected with the real world.

We also want to have a different approach to combat, but this will be revealed closer to the release date.

The history of the game will be hidden inside its items, characters, runes and scrolls. No big cutscenes is something that we want to stick to. The content will have to be discovered by the players (and sometimes, created by them)! 

The following images are concepts of some of our first heroes, and for the looks of them, you can gather that we included technology and magic together, and right now we are calling our setting a CyberFantasy setting, which is almost self explanatory! :)

They live in Critalia, another dimension heavilly influenced by ours. Their heroes have their great powers activated by humans (we) interacting with with them via some strange devices (smartphones). Their world and ours are connected by this breach created by our game!


Tune in into our announcements and be prepared to uncover what is this connection and influence that our Real world has into the Heroes Critalia World.

Above you can find a concept art for one of our first Heroes, Gharak Garathron, a Cyber Mage Polar bear, war veteran, and Great Hero of Critalia.

Yen is a Tactical Ninja Assassin. She is super sneaky, with invisibility skills and deadly tools. If you are seeing her, and if you are not dead, be sure that it is her courtesy.
