### Welcome to Mach874k's FAQ!

If your question is not answered here in this document, please send us a message.

#### 1.How big is the company

Right now we are super small, consisting of 6-10 people. We want to grow a bit, but not too much. Small teams are better to focus and easier to coordinate.

#### 2. Data We Collect

We only collect your email if you send us a message, but we don't store it outside of our email client, and we won't send you unrequested publicity.

#### 3. When will RRPG be launched

To be defined. We want to finish as fast as possible, but at the same time, we want it to reach your mobile phone when it is ready to receive players!

#### 4. Are you Hiring?

Yes! We are looking especially for 2d/3d artists and developers. Send us your CV and we will probably get in touch.
